##  For Validators Running Cosmovisor

Please refer to our [Cosmovisor](https://upticknft.gitbook.io/uptick-network-documentation/guides/quickstart/cosmovisor) Setup Guide.

Please Note: Cosmovisor will perform a full backup unless you set the environment variable: UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true

```bash
# make a dir if you've not
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.3.0/bin

#Download the source code and build it
git clone https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick.git
cd uptick
git checkout v0.3.0
make build

#Copy binary files
cp ./build/uptickd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.3.0/bin/

# View version should be v0.3.0
$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.3.0/bin/uptickd version --long
#commit: c8fec8051a71068bdefa6d6663aace374558eafe

```

## For Validators NOT Using Cosmovisor

The chain will halt at the target block. Please manually update your binary as follows:

```bash
#Download the source code and build it
git clone https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick.git
cd uptick
git checkout v0.3.0
make install

# View version should be v0.3.0
uptickd version --long
#commit: c8fec8051a71068bdefa6d6663aace374558eafe
```

Thank you for your cooperation and continued support for the Uptick Origin testnet!
