# v0.2.15-origin Upgrade

The upgrade is scheduled for block `3137401`, which should be about 11:00AM UTC on December 16th. 2023.

These instructions assume you are running Cosmovisor. Most mainnet validators are running Cosmovisor, and [a setup guide can be found here](https://upticknft.gitbook.io/uptick-network-documentation/guides/quickstart/cosmovisor).

NOTE: Cosmovisor will preform a full backup unless `UNSAFE_SKIP_BACKUP=true` is set as an environment variable.

```bash
# make a dir if you've not
mkdir -p $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.2.15-origin/bin

#Download the source code and build it
git clone https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick.git
cd uptick
git checkout v0.2.15-origin
make build

#Copy binary files
cp ./build/uptickd $DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.2.15-origin/bin/

# View version- should be v0.2.15-origin
$DAEMON_HOME/cosmovisor/upgrades/v0.2.15-origin/bin/uptickd version

```

If you are not using Cosmovisor, then the chain will halt at the target height and you can manually switch over.

```bash
#Download the source code and build it
git clone https://github.com/UptickNetwork/uptick.git
cd uptick
git checkout v0.2.15-origin
make install

# View version- should be v0.2.15-origin
uptickd version
```
